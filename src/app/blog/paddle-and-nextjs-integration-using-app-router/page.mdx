I recently launched my first product, an [AI language tutor](https://parlamigo.com) on Telegram. One of the first things I had to decide was a payment provider.

After debating between Stripe, Lemon Squeezy, and [Paddle](https://www.paddle.com/), I decided to go with the latter. Stripe is not a merchant of record, and Lemon Squeezy had hidden fees. Paddle, on the other hand, ticked all the boxes.

However, it comes with its own problems. Unfortunately, it doesn't provide purchase links, pre-built checkout pages, or price tables. You have to build everything yourself.

In this post, I'll show you how I integrated Paddle with Next.js for a subscription-based product.

## Creating a Sandbox Account for Development

I assume you don't want to make real purchases every time you need to test the checkout flow. You have to create a sandbox account for development.

Head over to the [Paddle Sandbox Dashboard](https://sandbox-vendors.paddle.com) and create an account. You can use the same email as your production account. They are independent of each other.

## Creating Products

After creating an account, you have to create products. If you're selling a subscription, you can think of products as subscription tiers. For example, if you have `basic` and `pro` tiers, you can create two products: one for `basic` and one for `pro`.

Head over to [Catalog / Products](https://sandbox-vendors.paddle.com/products-v2) and create your products.

## Creating Prices

We said that products are like subscription tiers. Prices are the payment plans for these tiers. You can create multiple prices for a single product. For example, you can create a monthly and a yearly price for each tier.

Click one of your products to create a price for it. Set `Min` and `Max` fields to `1` if you're selling a subscription to avoid multiple purchases.

Each price has a unique price ID. You will use this ID to create a checkout link.

## Setting Environment Variables

Before we start coding, we have to set some environment variables. Head over to [Developer Tools / Authentication](https://sandbox-vendors.paddle.com/authentication-v2) to get your client token.

Create a `.env.development` file in the root of your project and set the following variables.

```text filename=".env.development"
NEXT_PUBLIC_PADDLE_ENVIRONMENT=sandbox
NEXT_PUBLIC_PADDLE_CLIENT_TOKEN=
```

## Implementing a Checkout Page

Paddle supports two types of checkout: overlay and inline. I chose overlay checkout since it's much easier to implement. Inline checkout doesn't show any product or price information, so you have to build your own UI.

I recommend creating a dedicated page even if you decide to use overlay checkout like me. This provides two benefits:

- You have a shareable checkout link like Stripe.
- The same page can be used for payment method update link.

First, go to the [Checkout Settings](https://sandbox-vendors.paddle.com/checkout-settings) page and set the `Default payment link`. This is used by Paddle to create payment method update links.

Create a new page under the app directory without `use client` in it. Keep it as a RSC to fetch any server data. You can then pass them to `<Checkout />` as props.

```tsx filename="src/app/checkout/page.tsx"
import { Checkout } from '@/components/Checkout';
import { Metadata } from 'next';

export const metadata: Metadata = {
  title: 'Checkout',
};

export default async function Page() {
  const user = await getUser();

  return <Checkout user={user} />;
}
```

## Implementing the Checkout Component

This is where all the checkout magic happens. It must be a client component since we'll be using some hooks and [Paddle.js](https://developer.paddle.com/paddlejs/overview) library.

Install `@paddle/paddle-js` package. It's a wrapper around Paddle.js. It takes care of loading `https://cdn.paddle.com/paddle/v2/paddle.js` file and initializing it.

```bash
npm install @paddle/paddle-js
```

After that, create the `Checkout` component. Check the comments for a detailed explanation.

```tsx filename="src/components/Checkout.tsx"
'use client';

import { initializePaddle, Paddle } from '@paddle/paddle-js';
import { useRouter, useSearchParams } from 'next/navigation';
import { useEffect, useState } from 'react';

export interface CheckoutProps {
  user?: User;
}

export function Checkout({ user }: CheckoutProps) {
  const router = useRouter();
  const searchParams = useSearchParams();

  const [paddle, setPaddle] = useState<Paddle>();

  useEffect(() => {
    // Don't worry about initializing it multiple times between navigations.
    // Paddle library will be initialized as a singleton instance in a global variable.
    // Subsequent calls to `initializePaddle` will return the same instance.
    initializePaddle({
      environment: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_PADDLE_ENVIRONMENT,
      token: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_PADDLE_CLIENT_TOKEN,
      eventCallback(event) {
        switch (event.name) {
          // Redirect to home page after checkout is closed
          case 'checkout.closed':
            router.push('/');
            break;
        }
      },
    }).then((paddleInstance) => {
      if (paddleInstance) {
        setPaddle(paddleInstance);
      }
    });
  }, []);

  useEffect(() => {
    // This is passed by Paddle when the customer clicks a payment method update link.
    // The link is included in payment confirmation emails.
    // The link can also be retrieved from the Paddle API in `subscription.management_urls.update_payment_method`
    // You can also manually pass the transaction ID for the same purpose.
    let transactionId = searchParams.get('_ptxn');

    if (transactionId) {
      paddle?.Checkout.open({
        settings: {
          allowLogout: false,
        },
        transactionId,
      });
      return;
    }

    // Pass the priceId as a search parameter to the checkout page.
    let priceId = searchParams.get('priceId');

    if (priceId) {
      paddle?.Checkout.open({
        settings: {
          // Prevent user from changing their email
          allowLogout: false,
        },
        items: [{ priceId, quantity: 1 }],
        customer: {
          // You can pass the customer ID if you have it
          // This is the Paddle customer ID, not the user ID from your database
          id: user.customerId,
          // You can pass the customer email if you have it
          // You can't use it if you're passing id.
          email: user.email,
        },
        // You can pass additional data to the subscription
        customData: {
          userId: user.id,
        },
      });
      return;
    }

    // Redirect to the home page if no transactionId or priceId
    router.push('/');
  }, [paddle?.Checkout, searchParams]);

  return <p>Preparing checkout...</p>;
}
```

For all the available options, check the [Paddle.Checkout.open()](https://developer.paddle.com/paddlejs/methods/paddle-checkout-open) method documentation.

## Webhooks

Paddle sends events to your server via webhooks. For example, after a customer purchases a subscription successfully, Paddle sends a `subscription.created` event. You can use this event to update the user's subscription status in your database.

Head over to [Developer Tools / Notifications](https://sandbox-vendors.paddle.com/notifications) to create a webhook. For development, you can use [Cloudflare Quick Tunnels](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/do-more-with-tunnels/trycloudflare/) to expose your development server to the internet and use its URL when creating the webhook.

When creating a webhook, you will see a list of events to listen to. I recommend the below events at a minimum.

- `transaction.paid`
- `subscription.activated`
- `subscription.cancelled`
- `subscription.created`
- `subscription.past_due`
- `subscription.updated`

Check the [provisioning documentation](https://developer.paddle.com/build/subscriptions/provision-access-webhooks) for further implementation and security considerations.

After creating a webhook, it will generate a secret key. We will need this key to verify the webhook payload. Get it from the dashboard and set it as an environment variable.

We will also need a Paddle API key for the [Paddle Node.js SDK](https://github.com/PaddleHQ/paddle-node-sdk), which will be used to verify the webhook payload. You can get it from [Developer Tools / Authentication](https://sandbox-vendors.paddle.com/authentication-v2).

Do not expose them to the JS bundle since these are secrets.

```text filename=".env.development"
PADDLE_WEBHOOK_SECRET_KEY=
PADDLE_API_KEY=
```

Install the Paddle Node.js SDK.

```bash
npm install @paddle/paddle-node-sdk
```

Now, we need to create a POST request endpoint to listen to these events. Luckily, we can use [route handlers](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/route-handlers) for this.

Add this path to the end of the generated Cloudflare Quick Tunnel URL and update the webhook URL in the Paddle dashboard. It should be something like this: `https://poverty-spider-rich-thousand.trycloudflare.com/paddle-webhook`.

```ts filename="src/app/paddle-webhook/route.ts"
import { Environment, Paddle } from '@paddle/paddle-node-sdk';
import { NextRequest, NextResponse } from 'next/server';

export const paddle = new Paddle(process.env.PADDLE_API_KEY, {
  environment: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_PADDLE_ENVIRONMENT as Environment,
});

export async function POST(request: NextRequest) {
  const signature = request.headers.get('paddle-signature') ?? '';
  const body = await request.text();

  try {
    if (signature && body) {
      const payload = paddle.webhooks.unmarshal(
        body,
        process.env.PADDLE_WEBHOOK_SECRET_KEY,
        signature,
      );

      switch (payload.eventType) {
        // Handle events
        default:
          console.log(payload.eventType);
      }
    } else {
      console.error('Signature missing in header.');
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
  }

  return new NextResponse('Processed webhook event', { status: 200 });
}
```

Check the [Paddle webhooks documentation](https://developer.paddle.com/webhooks/overview) for further implementation and security considerations.

You can process these events as background jobs for robustness. Since Next.js doesn't provide this functionality, you can use a platform like [Trigger.dev](https://trigger.dev/docs/guides/frameworks/nextjs#triggering-your-task-in-next-js) for this purpose.

## Conclusion

Integrating Paddle with Next.js is not as straightforward as Stripe. You have to build everything yourself. However, it gives you more control over the checkout flow and the UI.
