I was building an iOS app using Expo. However, universe wanted to send me a message and gave me an unsolvable issue about the core functionality of my app. Uploading photos...

React Native [patches FormData Web API](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/v0.76.3/packages/react-native/Libraries/Network/FormData.js) to support sending local files in a request. Instead of appending a `File` or `Blob`, you append a JS object with local file URI. Here is an example:

```ts
const result = await ImagePicker.launchImageLibraryAsync({
  mediaTypes: ['images'],
  allowsMultipleSelection: true,
});

const formData = new FormData();

for (const asset of result.assets) {
  // @ts-expect-error: special react native format for form data
  formData.append(`photos`, {
    uri: asset.uri,
    name: asset.fileName,
    type: asset.mimeType,
  });
}

await fetch('http://localhost:3000/api', {
  method: 'POST',
  body: formData,
});
```

But there was something wrong. No matter what I did, the server was not able to parse it. First, I thought it's a problem with [Nitro](https://nitro.build/). Then I tried [Hono](https://hono.dev/) and it was the same. I was getting an error like `Failed to parse body as FormData` over and over again. After spending countless hours debugging on the server, I was convinced that it was a React Native problem.

One of my Google searches lead me to [this](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/44737) React Native issue on GitHub. Long story short, [this](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/35060) PR added an additional header value to `FormData` patch to support non-ascii characters in file names.

`Content-Disposition` header has a directive called `filename` which doesn't support ascii characters. However, there is another directive called `filename*` which supports it. But, there is a catch. `multipart/form-data` doesn't have `filename*` directive. In the mentioned commit, React Native adds this directive to support non-ascii characters. As a result, server parsers are not able to parse the request body as `FormData`.

> Note that the request header does not have the filename\* parameter and does not allow RFC 5987 encoding.

These are all related to some RFCs as explained in [Content-Disposition MDN docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Disposition).

## The workaround

The [relevant GitHub issue](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/44737) is open since May 2024 and there is no light in the horizon.

As a result, I created a genius workaround. I patched the already patched `FormData` implementation and used it ðŸ¤¡

I created a `CustomFormData` class and extended the global `FormData` class. Then I overwrote the [getParts](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/605e2e443bf893d5896f1d613cac763564dc3f69/packages/react-native/Libraries/Network/FormData.js#L73-L96) method implementation from the React Native repo. The only change is the removal of `filename*` directive.

```ts
type Headers = { [name: string]: string };
type FormDataPart =
  | {
      string: string;
      headers: Headers;
    }
  | {
      uri: string;
      headers: Headers;
      name?: string;
      type?: string;
    };

export class CustomFormData extends FormData {
  constructor() {
    super();
  }

  getParts(): Array<FormDataPart> {
    // @ts-expect-error
    return this._parts.map(([name, value]) => {
      const contentDisposition = 'form-data; name="' + name + '"';

      const headers: Headers = { 'content-disposition': contentDisposition };

      // The body part is a "blob", which in React Native just means
      // an object with a `uri` attribute. Optionally, it can also
      // have a `name` and `type` attribute to specify filename and
      // content type (cf. web Blob interface.)
      if (typeof value === 'object' && !Array.isArray(value) && value) {
        if (typeof value.name === 'string') {
          headers['content-disposition'] += `; filename="${value.name}"`;
        }
        if (typeof value.type === 'string') {
          headers['content-type'] = value.type;
        }
        return { ...value, headers, fieldName: name };
      }
      // Convert non-object values to strings as per FormData.append() spec
      return { string: String(value), headers, fieldName: name };
    });
  }
}
```

Once you have the workaround, the usage is simple. Use the `CustomFormData` class in React Native code instead of `FormData`.

```ts
const result = await ImagePicker.launchImageLibraryAsync({
  mediaTypes: ['images'],
  allowsMultipleSelection: true,
});

const formData = new CustomFormData();

for (const asset of result.assets) {
  // @ts-expect-error: special react native format for form data
  formData.append(`photos`, {
    uri: asset.uri,
    name: asset.fileName,
    type: asset.mimeType,
  });
}

await fetch('http://localhost:3000', {
  method: 'POST',
  body: formData,
});
```

Note that, I tested this only on iOS development build. It may not work on other environments. But at least you'll know what's the issue.
